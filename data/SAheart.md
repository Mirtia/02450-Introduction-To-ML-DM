# Dataset Information

A retrospective sample of males in a heart-disease high-risk region of the Western Cape, South Africa. There are roughly two controls per case of CHD. Many of the CHD positive men have undergone blood
pressure reduction treatment and other programs to reduce their risk factors after their CHD (Coronary Heart Disease) event. In some cases the measurements were made after these treatments. These data are taken from a larger dataset, described in  Rousseauw et al, 1983, South African Medical Journal.
